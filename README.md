# Ethereum Smart Wallet

This project demonstrates a limited-feature version of an Ethereum Smart Wallet with innovative authentication mechanisms. The smart wallet allows users to securely access their Ethereum wallets using various modern authentication methods.

## Features

- **Social Media Authentication:** Users can access their wallets through social media platforms using One-Time Passwords (OTPs). This integration allows for a more seamless and user-friendly login experience.
- **Biometric Authentication:** The wallet supports biometric authentication, providing an additional layer of security. Users can authenticate using their fingerprint or facial recognition, depending on their device capabilities.
- **Passcode Authentication:** For added security, users can also access their wallets using a passcode. This traditional method complements the more advanced authentication options.
